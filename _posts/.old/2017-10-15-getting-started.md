# Getting started

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) can automatically generate and serve the website for you.
Let's say you have a username/organisation `my-org` and project `my-proj`; if you locate Jekyll source under `blog` folder of master branch in your repo `github.com/my-org/my-proj`, the website will be served on `my-org.github.io/my-proj`.

1. Just download or fork and clone the source from [github.com/janczizikow/sleek](https://github.com/janczizikow/sleek/).
2. Make sure your local machine has ruby and node
3. Edit site settings in  `_config.yml` file according to your project.
4. Replace `favicons` and `_includes/logo.svg` with your own logo.

**Note** that you might have to adjust some CSS depending on the width and height of your logo. You can find Header / Navigation related SCSS in `_sass/layout/nav.scss`.

## Writing content

### Posts

Create a new Markdown file such as `2017-01-13-my-post.md` in `_post` folder. Configure YAML Front Matter (stuff between `---`):

```yaml

---
layout: post # needs to be post
title: Getting Started with Sleek # title of your post
featured-img: sleek #optional - if you want you can include hero image
---

```

#### Images

In case you want to add a hero image to the post, apart from changing `featured-img` in YAML, you also need to add the image file to the project. To do so, just upload an image in `.jpg` format to `_img` folder. The name must before the `.jpg` file extension has to match with `featured-img` in YAML. Next, run `gulp img` from command line to generate optimized version of the image and all the thumbnails. You have to restart  the jekyll server to see the changes. Sleek uses [Lazy Sizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes) Lazy Loader for loading images. Check the link for more info. Lazy Sizes doesnt't require any configuration and it's going to be included in your bundled js file.

### Pages

The home page is located under `index.md` file. To change the content or design you have to edit the `default.html` file in `_layouts` folder.

In order to add a new page, create a new html or markdown file under root directory or inside `_pages` folder. To add a link to the page, edit `navigation` setting in `_config.yml`.

### Images TODO

Introduce gulp optimization

Breakpoint | Image Type | Width | Retina
------------ | ------------ | ------------- | -------------
xs |Post Thumb | 535px | 1070px
sm |Post Thumb | 500px| 1000px
md |Post Thumb | 329.375px | 658.75px
lg |Post Thumb | 445.625px | 891.25px
xl |Post Thumb | 353.125px | 706.25px

Breakpoint | Image Type | Width | Retina
------------ | ------------ | ------------- | -------------
xs |Post Hero | 535px | 1070px
sm |Post Hero | 500px| 1000px
md |Post Hero | 329.375px | 658.75px
lg |Post Hero | 445.625px | 891.25px
xl |Post Hero | 353.125px | 706.25px

### MathJax

If you want to use [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in your posts, add `mathjax: true` in [YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) of your post:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: Blog Post with MathJax
featured-img: sleek # optional - if you want you can include name of hero image
mathjax: true # add this line in order to enable MathJax in the post
---
```

#### Example

In N-dimensional simplex noise, the squared kernel summation radius $r^2$ is $\frac 1 2$
for all values of N. This is because the edge length of the N-simplex $s = \sqrt {\frac {N} {N + 1}}$
divides out of the N-simplex height $h = s \sqrt {\frac {N + 1} {2N}}$.
The kerel summation radius $r$ is equal to the N-simplex height $h$.

$$ r = h = \sqrt{\frac {1} {2}} = \sqrt{\frac {N} {N+1}} \sqrt{\frac {N+1} {2N}} $$
Happy hacking!
